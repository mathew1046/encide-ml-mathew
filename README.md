# 🐾 Cats vs Dogs Classifier (Mini Dataset)

I built a binary image classifier using MobileNetV2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, with transfer learning to classify cats and dogs using a small dataset of around 1,000 images (500 cats and 500 dogs). The dataset was organized into Cat/ and Dog/ folders under data/, and the model was trained in Google Colab. After preprocessing and data augmentation, the model was fine-tuned and achieved high accuracy (~96%) on the validation set. Predictions on a separate test set were saved in a CSV file with filenames and labels.
